Alphabet A={0,1,:,^,M,m,?}
Machine M={instruction read head, output read/write head, instruction tape, output tape} 
0 - 0 bit
1 - 1 bit
: - Instruction terminator.
^ - Output write token. Write all bits after this instruction until the instruction terminator.
M - Instruction tape move token. First bit after "M" determines left (0) or right (1). Read
the remaining bits until the instruction terminator as numbers. Move that many bits in the given
direction after the terminator.
m - Output tape move token. Same as above.
? - Output conditional. Same as above but asking about the output read/write head.
